Below is a recent past exam. The course content varies from year to year, as well as its focus. Therefore, it must not be considered as a mock exam but as an example of the type of questions that can be asked. Furthermore, the answer booklet is an example of the file on which you will solve the exam. During the exam, a lot of flexibility is accepted in its use (copy-paste, include images, adapt answer space, etc.) as long as the presentation of the solutions follows the question orders.
