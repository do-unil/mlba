### Supervised vs unsupervised learning

**Supervised learning** aims to predict an outcome $y$ from features
$x$. The quality of the model can be inspected by comparing the
predictions to the true outcomes. **Unsupervised learning** aims to analyze the link between the features. There is no "supervisor". Unsupervised methods can be separated in two main ones:

-   **Clustering**: group instances according to their similarities
    across the features.

-   **Dimension reduction**: link the features according to their
    similarities across the instances, find commonalities, and combine
    the features in fewer dimensions.
