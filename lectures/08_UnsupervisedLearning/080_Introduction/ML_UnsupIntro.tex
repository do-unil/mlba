\frametitle{Supervised vs unsupervised learning}
{\bf Supervised learning} aims to predict an outcome $y$ from features $x$. The quality of the model can be inspected by comparing the predictions to the true outcomes.\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
{\bf Unsupervised learning} aims to analyze the link between the features. There is no ``supervisor''. Unsupervised methods can be separated in two main ones:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Clustering}: group instances according to their similarities across the features.
\item {\bf Dimension reduction}: link the features according to their similarities across the instances, find commonalities, and combine the features in fewer dimensions. 
\end{itemize}
