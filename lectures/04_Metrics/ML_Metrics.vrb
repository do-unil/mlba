\frametitle{The $R^2$}
In the ML context, the $R^2$ ({\bf $R$ squared}) is the square of the correlation between the observations and the predictions.
$$
R^2 = cor(y,f(x;\theta))
$$
The $R^2$ is bounded between 0 and 1. The larger the $R^2$, the better the model.\\

The $R^2$ is an attempt to approximate / replace the usual $R^2$ of a linear regression. However, these two must not be confounded because they will often be different (though conveying the same idea).
