        "This course presents several machine learning techniques in business and management contexts. The list of topics is meant to cover mainly supervised methods of classification and prediction although unsupervised methods are also seen. Below is a tentative lists of topics. It will be adapted according to the pace of the class:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Supervised learning models: regressions, trees, support vector machine, neural networks.\n",
        "- Data splitting: training/test sets, cross-validation, bootstrap.\n",
        "- Metrics: MSE, Accuracy, ...\n",
        "- Ensemble methods: bagging, random forests, boosting.\n",
        "- Unsupervised learning: clustering, PCA, FAMD, Auto-Encoder\n",
        "- Interpretable machine learning: variale importance, partial dependence plots, LIME.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exercises and theory are equally important for the success of the class. For the excercises we use primarly R, with equivalent code in Python.\n",
